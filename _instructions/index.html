        <h1>Hot Restaurant Mini Project</h1>
        <p>In preparation for our start of project #1, we are going to build a mini-project with our team 
            today - of which we will be doing the full range of skills from UI build to the actual API's.</p>

        <h2>1.0 GOAL</h2>
        <p>Our end goal is to use build a restaurant booking application -- the full stack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1) We will use bootstrap to build a UI similar to the below pictures -- there are 3 unique pages</li>
            <li>2) We are building a node server to serve the pages, and handle the API's</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The homepage (index.html):</p>
        <img src="assets/layout_main.jpg" style='width:25vw;' />

        <p>The full listing of tables booked (listings.html):</p>
        <img src="assets/layout_listing.jpg" style='width:25vw;' />

        <p>When adding an entry (reserve.html):</p>
        <img src="assets/layout_add.jpg" style='width:25vw;' />

        <h1>2.0 BUILD PLAN (20 mins)</h1>
        <p>To tackle this project there will likely be 3 key phrases</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do a cursory review of the overall app: what's happening?</li>
            <li>What resources are needed (bootstrap? anything else?) </li>
            <li>What data will be stored, and what API endpoints will be used? Do you need to register? Examine the API (hint see section 2.1)</li>
            <li>Plan the steps to build:</li>
            <li>&nbsp; a) Wireframe out the logic - user will type search parameters, then ajax call, then display </li>
            <li>&nbsp; b) Have some of your team start building the HTML, put in placeholder results.</li>
            <li>&nbsp; c) Have other members of your team do the API-call tests</li>
            <li>&nbsp; d) Build components, test, merge them, test/debug overall app.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.1 API (10 mins)</h2>
        <p>Look at the working application and decide what endpoints your application will 
            need. ex. How will you get the table listing? How will you save a table listing?
        </p>
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>3.0 CODE (120 mins)</h1>
        <h5>UI Team</h5>
        <p>Build the initial UI, and remember to have input boxes to capture the fields 
            needed. 
        </p>
        <p>Use <a href='https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=coffee' target=_blank>FontAwesome.com</a> for some awesome 
        icons to enhance your site!</p>
        <p>Once built, wire up the capturing of inputs and display them in the console.log</p>
        </p>
        <p>Create fake table data -- coordinate with the API team -- so you can start rendering 
            this into the UI. Once the actual API's are ready, you will switch out and make sure 
            your javascript fetch/$.ajax calls work.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, look at proper messaging and error handling (incorrectly filled fields, API errors, etc)</p>
        
        <h5>API Team</h5>
        <p>Create fake table data Examine the API data and wire-up the result output to show the matching data.</p>
        <p><b>Remember to use a LOT of console.log comments to understand what is happening at each step of AJAX call.</b></p>
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>4.0 INTEGRATE & POLISH (30 mins)</h1>
        <p>Integrate and finish up UI elements, and error message handling, etc.</p>
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>5.0 BONUS FEATURES</h1>
        <p>If you manage to complete it in time, consider adding these two features to your 
            sites:
            <ul><li>
                <b>Persistence</b>: Save your table reservations to a file (ex. tables.json), such that restarting 
                the node server (after changes, if it crashes, etc), will still have your important 
                reservations.
            </li>
            <li><b>Table Editing</b> Allow editing individual table entries if people get the 
            name or phone number wrong... or if they want to delete their reservation!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>6.0 DEPLOY (20 mins)</h1>
        <p>Now that it's built, it's time to deploy it to Heroku! See supplementary reading 
            material -- or ask Daniel to help you with this!
        </p>
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>7.0 CELEBRATE</h1>
        
        <p>Congratulations on tackling a challenging full-stack project!
